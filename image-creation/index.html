    <h4>Some thoughts on Image Optimization</h4>
    <p>Optimizing images is when you reduce the file size of an image so that when it’s embedded on your website, it doesn’t slow your load speed down.</p>
    <p>Making sure that your website loads fast is important because slow websites don’t keep users. It’s important to be able to retain users. After all, users spending time on your site generates more revenue.</p>
    <p>Web speed is also important because browsers are more likely to push up a fast website as opposed to a slow one. This is called Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.</p>
        With images, it’s important to find a balance between a low file size and decent quality. While you want to keep the file size of the image as low as possible, you don’t want to sacrifice the quality of the image. Low quality images look pixelated and grainy. You may have to increase the image quality. Having clear images on your website will make your website look much more polished.
