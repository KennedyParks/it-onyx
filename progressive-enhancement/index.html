    <h1>Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a technique used by web designers and developers to make the content and functionality of websites as accessible to all browsers and devices (including older ones) as possible. This is done by first building a foundation for the site by building it in a way that allows basic functioning for older browsers or devices that can’t support newer development updates. Then, after that’s achieved, stylistic and functional changes are added to make the site more complex and modern for newer browsers and devices that can support new languages. In short, the process goes from simple to complex.

        Progressive enhancement functionally runs opposite to another web building technique called Graceful Degradation. Graceful Degradation goes from complex to simple, meaning that building the website for newer browsers and devices like adding JavaScript and CSS comes first - or happens at the same time as building the foundation of the site, and the basic functionality of the website is more of an afterthought. This isn’t ideal because the functionality of the website is more likely to break when someone uses an older browser or device.
        
        Progressive Enhancement prevents that from happening by covering all of those corners from the beginning.
        
        Ultimately, the Progressive Enhancement technique creates a more accessible and equitable web experience for all users machines.
