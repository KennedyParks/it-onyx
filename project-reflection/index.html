    <h1>Project Reflection</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, I built a website for a vegan restaurant called The House of Mental. I think that my web project turned out fine. I don’t think it’s one of my best websites as it’s pretty simple, but it’s functional for its purpose. I implemented the features that I thought were essential like simple grid layout, an interactive map showing the location of The House of Mental, the hours, the menu, and some outstanding Yelp reviews. 
        This semester proved to be a bit overwhelming with the amount of coding projects I had going on outside of school so unfortunately this site isn’t as robust as I could have made it, but if I spent more time fleshing it out, I would have added the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I would have redesigned the menu in Illustrator and uploaded a clickable PDF instead of that image of a physical menu. This would look much more clean and professional</li>
            <li>I would have made the navigation bar collapsible in mobile view</li>
            <li>I would have made a much more detailed about section</li>
            <li>I probably would have made specific pages for each section so I could fit more content into them</li>
            <li>I would have added either a Facebook or an Instagram widget in the footer so users could keep up with posts</li>
            <li>I would do some styling to the borders of the images so they looked nicer</li>
            <li>I’d maybe add a bit of javascript code displaying in real time whether or not the House of Mental was open depending on the time of the day.</li>
            <li>I’d add a fully functioning contact page
            </li>
        </ul>
